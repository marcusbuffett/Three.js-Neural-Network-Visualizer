Three.js on Bower
------

Official repo: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#threejs
Official repo is too large on Bower, so I picked files out from that repo.

Current version: [r71](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r71).
In this repo the version in converted to `0.71.0` in semantic version for Bower to recognize.

### Usage

```
bower install --save three.js
```

### Notice

Last time the version was `0.0.68`. However `0.68.0` looks better because the last one is for patch. So there was a switch. Hopefully it doesn't break things.
